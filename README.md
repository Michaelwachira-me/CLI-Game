# Echoes of Gaia: Unite Elements, Restore the World

***

## Game Description 

The World and the people of `Gaia` once lived in unity. The world's key Spirits - elements of air, water, fire, and earch - maintained balance between human beings and nature. However, division, greed, and immorality corrupted Gaia's harmony and the Spirit's willingness to maintain balance. Currently, the Spirits hide in plain sight as corrupted and confused beings.

As a player, you are a `Seeker`, divinely selected to connect with the Spirits and restore Gaia's balance. 

In this game that draws from social realism, how well can you understand the monsters' pain, build trust, and enable healing that will restore humanity and nature?

Rather than trying to conquer the Monster, can you make the difficult decisions and build your spiritual strength to ensure that the Monsters emphathize with Gaia's call for balance?
